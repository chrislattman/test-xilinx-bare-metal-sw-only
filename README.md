## Bare-metal Xilinx application

This project is an example of a bare-metal software/hardware application for the Zynq-7000 SoC (specifically the Arty Z7-20 board).
The software application was developed in Vitis Unified IDE 2025.1, and it's built on top of an XSA file generated by Vivado 2025.1.
The XSA file is normally generated in Vivado (by generating the block design and then running synthesis and then implementation/place & route), but for this toy example I've included `fpga/artyz7_wrapper.xsa` for convenience.
The XSA file doesn't include a FPGA bitstream since there is no programmable logic (PL) in this example.
However, the XSA file is still needed as it defines the hardware platform which the software runs on, including enabling the AXI GPIO used to toggle the LED in this example.
